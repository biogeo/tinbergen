To-do list:

1. Write some basic documentation
2. Change file format to YAML (or possibly JSON) for auto-magic readability (in a separate branch so others can continue using "classic" file format)
    YAML:
        Very readable
        Libraries available in lots of languages (including Matlab with mat-yaml)
        Slightly less intuitive to write ethogram files?
        Requires PyYAML for Python, which means Tinbergen depends on PyYAML
            Not that big a deal, actually: already depends on GStreamer, can install from repos.
    JSON:
        JSON is part of the Python core library; no extra dependencies
        Writing ethogram files not intuitive for non-programmers
    Current tbobs:
        Very readable; easy to write ethograms
        Will require an importer for each new language (easy with regex, but still a barrier)
    CSV:
        Highly portable, including into Excel
        Not especially intuitive to write ethograms
        May be overly limiting
3. Include a mechanism for the coders to identify specific behavior channels as "complete" or not
4. Graphical display of behavior channels with movie (low priority)
5. Include basic information about movie files in tbobs files (resolution, FPS, etc)
