To-do list:

1. Write some basic documentation
2. Change file format to YAML (or possibly JSON) for auto-magic readability (in a separate branch so others can continue using "classic" file format)
3. Include a mechanism for the coders to identify specific behavior channels as "complete" or not
4. Graphical display of behavior channels with movie (low priority)
